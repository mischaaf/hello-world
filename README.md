# hello-world
My place for ideas and quick notes :)

Hey, this is Miri. I am 24 years old, study Cognitive Science and enjoy doing sports and dancing in my free time. I also love going out with my friends, reading a good book, watching Comedy series and baking. I am very much interested in psychology, medical topics, gender studies, skin care, fashion and interior design.
